# TGIRT smRNA #

This repository stores code for analyzing bias from [mirXplore miRNA reference data](https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/US-en/products/macsmolecular/reagents/nucleic-acid-research/microrna-research/mirxplore-universal-reference.html) sequenced by [TGIRT-seq](http://www.ingex.com/tgirt-enzyme/) using a set of new NTT primer.

We compared our data to small RNA data generated by [several different small RNA methods](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4183).
